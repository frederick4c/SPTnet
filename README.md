 ```
## 1. Installation
Python environment (via Anaconda)

**(1)**  Install Anaconda or Miniconda

**(2)** Through "Anaconda prompt" navigate to the folder with "SPTnet_environment.yml"

**(3)** Run the following command to create the environment
```
conda env create -f SPTnet_environment.yml
```
## 2. Instructions for generating training videos
This code has been tested on the following systems and packages:
Microsoft Windows 10 Education, Matlab R2021a, DIPimage 2.9 (http://www.diplib.org/)

**(1)** Change MATLAB current folder to the directory that contains “PSF-toolbox”.
Run ‘SPTnet_trainingdata_generator.m’ to generate the training dataset.

**(2)** The default settings will generate 5 files each containing 100 videos.

**Note:** SPTnet was trained with >200,000 videos to achieve precision approching CRLB. To generate more training and validation datasets, please locate the variables specifying the number of training videos in ‘SPTnet_trainingdata_generator.m’ (e.g., Num_file, Videos_per_file). Increase these values to the desired amount and producing additional .mat files containing more simulated videos for training and validation.

## 3. Instructions for training SPTnet using simulated training datasets
The code has been tested on the following systems and packages:
Ubuntu20.04LTS, Python3.9.12, Pytorch1.11.0, CUDA11.3, MatlabR2021a

**To start training,**

**(1)** Type the following command in the terminal: 
```
python SPTnet_training.py
```
**(2)** Select the folder to save the trained model

**(3)** Select the training data files.

**(4)** During the training, the model with the minimal validation loss will be saved as ‘trained_model’ onto the selected folder in step (2), together with an image of the training loss and validation loss changes along with training epoch.

(Example learning curves, training - red, validation - blue)


## 4. Instructions for running inference using a trained model
To test the trained model,

**(1)** Type the following command in terminal: 
```
python SPTnet_inference.py
```
**(2)** Select the trained model you will use for inference

**(3)** Select the video file that will be analyzed by SPTnet

**(4)** An output ‘.mat’ file will be generated under the ‘inference_results’ folder located in the directory of the selected model in step (2), which contains all the estimated trajectories, detection probabilities, Hurst exponents, and generalized diffusion coefficients ready for analysis or visualization.

**Note:** On a typical GPU-enabled PC, SPTnet can process a 30-frame video (each frame sized 64×64 pixels) in approximately 60 ms. Actual performance may vary depending on specific hardware configurations (GPU model, CPU, memory, etc.)

## 5. Instructions for visualizing the SPTnet output results using MATLAB
**(1)** Run ‘Visualize_SPTnet_Outputs.m’ or ‘Visualize_SPTnet_Outputs_GUI.m’

**(2)** Select the files used for testing the model

**(3)** Select the SPTnet inference results.

**(4)** By default, the tested videos with ground truth trajectories, Hurst exponent, and generalized diffusion coefficient will be shown in red, and the SPTnet estimation results will show different colors for different tracks. An example frame from the visualization result is showing below.
